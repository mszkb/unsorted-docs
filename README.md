# unsorted-docs
The main goal of unsorted-docs to keep my mostly markdown written documentation in a place where I can refer later on.

## Topics

- Docker & docker-compose
- Azure & Azure DevOps
- Vue.js
- Bash Scripts

I chose these topics because all the resources I find on the web are often garbage or I cannot apply those tutorials according to my needs.

## Roadmap

- Collect documentation from my machines and categorize them
- Free the documentations of my company and my earlier companies
- Generalize documentation so it cannot be linked to my previous customers and companies
- Release it to github pages
- Elasticsearch for Jekyll?
